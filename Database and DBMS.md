A **database** is an organized collection of data stored in a computer system and usually managed by a database management system (DBMS).

> - The most commonly used types of databases are Relational and NoSQL.
> - The data in relational databases is modeled in tables, making querying and processing efficient. Structured query language (SQL) is commonly used for data querying and writing.
> - The data in NoSQL databases is modeled as key-value pairs.
> - Examples of relational DBMS are MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL.
> - Examples of NoSQL DBMS are MongoDB, Cassandra and DynamoDB.

## Types of Databases

- ****Relational Databases:**** A relational database’s contents are arranged as a collection of tables with rows and columns. Accessing structured data is made most flexible and efficient by relational database technology.

- ****Object-Oriented Databases:**** Similar to [object-oriented programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-object-oriented-programming/), data in an object-oriented database is represented as objects.

- ****Distributed Databases:**** A distributed database is made up of two or more files that are spread across multiple locations. The database could be dispersed across many networks, housed in one physical place, or kept on several computers.

- ****Data Warehouses:**** A data warehouse is a sort of database created especially for quick query and analysis. It is a central repository for data.

- ****NoSQL Databases:**** Unlike relational databases, which specify how all data input must be formatted, NoSQL, or nonrelational databases, permit the storing and manipulation of unstructured and semi-structured data. The prevalence and complexity of online applications led to the rise in popularity of NoSQL databases.

- ****Graph Databases:**** Data is stored in a graph database using entities and their relationships.

- ****OLTP Database:**** An [OLTP database](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/on-line-transaction-processing-oltp-system-in-dbms/) is a quick, analytical database made to handle lots of transactions from several users at once.

- ****Open source databases:**** A database system that is open source can have either a [SQL or NoSQL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-sql-and-nosql/) database as its source code.

- ****Cloud databases:**** A collection of organized or unorganized data that is housed on a private, public, or hybrid cloud computing platform is known as a cloud database. Cloud database models come in two flavors: traditional and [database as a service (DBaaS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-database-as-a-service/). With DBaaS, a service provider handles maintenance and administrative duties.

## What is DBMS?

**Database Management System (DBMS)** is a collection of interrelated data and set of programs to access data example – MySQL, [Oracle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oracle-architecture/). 

- An interface for operations like creation, deletion, modification, etc. are provided by DBMS.
- DBMS allows the user to create their databases as per their requirement.
- DBMS accepts the request from the application and provides specific data through the operating system.
- DBMS contains a group of programs that acts according to the user’s instruction.
- It provides security to the database.

### Type of DBMS

- [[Relational DBMS]] (SQL)
- [[Non-Relational DBMS]] (NoSQL)
