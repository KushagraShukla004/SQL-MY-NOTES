```
SELECT col1_name, col2_name FROM table_name;
```
---
#### Select columns from different tables together:
```
SELECT table1.col_name, table2.col_name FROM table1, table2;
```
---
#### Select records in order:
Ascending Order:
```
SELECT col_name FROM table_name ORDER BY col_name ASC;
```
Descending Order:
```
SELECT col_name FROM table_name ORDER BY col_name DESC;
```
---
#### Select limited number of records only:

```
SELECT name, age FROM student
WHERE name = "John Doe";

##### Using `IN()` keyword: 
`IN()` keyword specifies group of values query should look for to show the records.
> we don't have to write `name = 'John Doe' or name = 'Anything' .... so on`
```
SELECT name,age FROM student
WHERE name IN ('John Doe', 'Anything');
```
